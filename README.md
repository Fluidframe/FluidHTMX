# FluidHTMX

FluidHTMX is a lightweight, high-performance framework that combines the simplicity of HTMX-like syntax with the power of WebSocket connections. It provides a seamless way to update DOM elements in real-time, offering the best of both worlds: the ease of use associated with AJAX requests and the efficiency of persistent WebSocket connections.

## Key Features:

- **WebSocket-Powered**: Utilizes a single, persistent WebSocket connection for efficient real-time updates.
- **Familiar Syntax**: Inspired by HTMX, allowing developers to use a declarative, HTML-centric approach for dynamic content.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Enables efficient rendering of DOM fragments on the server.
- **Bi-directional Communication**: Supports both server-to-client and client-to-server real-time updates.
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Reduces the need for complex client-side JavaScript, simplifying development and improving performance.
- **Flexible DOM Manipulation**: Supports various DOM operations including updates, insertions, removals, and attribute changes.

FluidHTMX aims to simplify real-time web application development by providing a robust, easy-to-use solution for dynamic DOM updates. It's perfect for developers looking to build responsive, real-time applications without the complexity typically associated with WebSocket implementations.
